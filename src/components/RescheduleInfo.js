            In these uncertain times, we hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy.

We’ve made the very difficult decision to postpone our wedding due to the ongoing circumstances. We want to ensure our friends and family can safely travel and gather together to celebrate with us and so we have moved our wedding date to May 22, 2021.

With this date change, we have also had to change our venue to the Canmore Nordic Centre. Please see the map for exact location details.

If you have already booked a room through our wedding block at Blackstone Mountain Lodge, you can cancel by calling 403-679-7098.

We’re truly sorry for the inconvenience but appreciate your understanding and love through this time, and we can’t wait to celebrate with you next year!

Please reach out if you have any questions.
